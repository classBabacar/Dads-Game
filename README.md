# Inspiration 
On random days my dad used to play this game with me where he would ask a series of question..and ultimately guess the number I was thinking of.

This is maybe the smallest program might even be considered dumb to some people...but I bother putting this on my github because I feel like I learned some things from this game: 

1. Math is cooooool!
2. My dad is evil for never telling me how the trick was done :(
3. Later on, I realized this problem can be done in another way. (There is never 1 solution to a problem)

# Keep the nostalgia
I'm pretty sure this was the first program I've ever wrote aside from school work, I see a lot of bad programming conventions. However, I'm gonna leave it here because it's pretty nostalgic. Even the randomly hanging ``cout hi`` lol.
