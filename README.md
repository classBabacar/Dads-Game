# Inspiration 
On random days my dad used to play this game with me where he would ask a series of question..and ultimately guess the number I was thinking of.

This is maybe the smallest program might even be considered dumb to some people...but I bother putting this on my github because I feel like I learned some things from this game: 

1. Math is cooooool!
2. My dad is evil for never showing me how the trick was done :( 
3. Later on, I realized this problem can be done in many other ways. (There is never 1 solution to a problem)
